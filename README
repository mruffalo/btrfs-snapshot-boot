This is a shell script addition to the Ubuntu initramfs tools that will create
btrfs snapshots of all top-level subvolumes (in each btrfs filesystem) on every
boot.

To use this on your system:
* For each btrfs filesystem that you'd like to snapshot on boot, mount the root
  subvolume and make a top-level 'snapshots' directory.
* Copy initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount/btrfs-snapshot to
  /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount
* Run 'update-initramfs'
* Reboot and cross your fingers. If your system doesn't boot correctly and/or
  you see a '(initramfs)' BusyBox prompt:
  - boot from a live CD 
  - Fix/delete /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-premount in your
    root filesystem
  - Run 'update-initramfs' again
